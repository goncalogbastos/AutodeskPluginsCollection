# Autodesk Plugins Collection

This repository aims to share the development of AutoCAD and Civil 3D commands for a professional context use.

AutoCAD and Civil 3D offer users the opportunity to develop custom plugins using the respective APIs. In this context, and for the development of infrastructures projects, the following commands were created in order to automate design tasks:

### AutoCAD Plugins

1) Create an auxiliar working layer;
2) Create a new layer;
3) Create a new block;
4) Insert an existing block;
5) Insert a polyline with a certain slope given by the user;
6) Insert a filed with the area of a closed polyne in a mtext label;
7) Double offset of a certain AutoCAD object;
8) Selection off all objects inside an outer object.

### Civil 3D Plugins

1) Create an alignment from a polyline;
2) Create a surface profile;
3) Create a profile view;
4) Change a corridor frequency;
5) Set all surface targets of a corridor.


For this code to run in your machine, you must allow AutoCAD and Civil3D to read the .dll files created by this solution.
